# Ball Simulation Exercise

_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

Description:
Maegan was instructed to make a circle bounce off an invisible border as her __first major assignment__ in her MERN Full Stack Development course. In a bonus lesson, she could make additional changes, such as multiple colors, sizes, velocity, etc. This is what she decided to do with it.

Roadmap:
While it is not very polished, it is her first project. As time goes on, she plans to revisit or simply recreate it to implement more features, such as:

- Having it bounce off of clearly-defined "walls."
- Interact with one another.
- Have it swap colors when they hit the boundary or each other.
- Give people the ability to add more with a left click or remove one by right-clicking it.
